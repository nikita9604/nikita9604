# Hi there! I am Nikita Rath

A 3rd Year undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Computer Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, India.

I am interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Data Analytics. I am currently a PRISM Developer at Samsung R&D India. I am passionately curious, detailed-oriented and a committed engineer. I like to constantly challenge myself and take up new things from learning a new programming language to doing something different than usual.
