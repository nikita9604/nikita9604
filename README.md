I am a 3rd Year undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Computer Engineering<br>at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, India.
</p>
<p align = "center">
I am interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Data Analytics 💻. I am currently a PRISM Developer at Samsung R&D India. 
I am passionately curious, detailed-oriented and a committed engineer. I like to constantly challenge myself and take up new things from learning a new programming language to doing something different than usual.
